Lost my mind trying to reword the original commit -m, my local repository history still haunts this repository. Please excuse the inaccuracy of the tutorial I am following, it is indeed Ted Jensen's "A Tutorial on Pointers and Arrays in C, Version 1.3 (MD version)". Thanks to @jflaherty (https://github.com/jflaherty) for preserving and uploading the tutorial to a public realm. Further commits will include the correct information.
